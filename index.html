				<h1> Shallow </h1>
				<h2> Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper - (A Star Is Born) </h2>
				<p> 
						Tell me somethin', girl <br>
						Are you happy in this modern world? <br>
						Or do you need more? <br>
						Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for? <br>
				</p>
				<p>  
						I'm falling <br> 
						In all the good times I find myself <br>
						Longin' for change <br> 
						And in the bad times I fear myself <br>
				</p>
				<p> 
						Tell me something, boy <br>
						Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? <br>
						Or do you need more? <br>
						Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore? <br>
				</p>
				<p>  
						I'm falling <br> 
						In all the good times I find myself <br>
						Longin' for change <br> 
						And in the bad times I fear myself <br>
				</p>
				<p>
						I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in <br>
						I'll never meet the ground <br>
						Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us <br>
						We're far from the shallow now <br>
				</p>
				<p>
						In the shallow, shallow <br>
						In the shallow, shallow <br>
						In the shallow, shallow <br> 
						We're far from the shallow now <br>
				</p>
				<p>
						Oh, oh, oh, oh <br> 
						Whoah! <br>
				</p>
				<p>
						I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in <br>
						I'll never meet the ground <br>
						Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us <br>
						We're far from the shallow now <br>
				</p>
				<p>
						In the shallow, shallow <br>
						In the shallow, shallow <br>
						In the shallow, shallow <br> 
						We're far from the shallow now <br>
